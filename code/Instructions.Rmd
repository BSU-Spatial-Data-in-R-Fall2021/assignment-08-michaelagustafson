## Your assignment

The goals for this assignment are to:

- practice making maps with the various packages
- think about composition and the grammar of graphics
- critique various maps

_By the end of the assignment_ you should have several static maps displaying the datasets we've used in the last few weeks.

# Task 1: Show me your ugly maps!!
Find 2 examples of maps that you think are 'bad'. 
_Question 1_ Why are they bad? What might improve them? 
_Question 2_ Rely on the Healy and Wilke texts to provide some structure to your answers.

![Bad Map 1](/home/michaela/R/assignment-08-michaelagustafson/code/badmap1.jpg)
Why is this a bad map? Using monocolor schemes isn't always the best choice. In this example, many of the colors are very similar, therefore, its hard to tell what color is actually corresponding to some states.

Bad Map 2
![Bad Map 2](/home/michaela/R/assignment-08-michaelagustafson/code/badmap2.png)
To me, this map is a little hard to understand. The lighter colored countries say that the reported religious affiliation is less than 90%, but how much less? And if it's less than 90% then maybe it isn't even the majority of the population that is affiliated with that religion and perhaps another religion is more prevalent. 


# Task 2: Load your libraries and build a dataframe
You can choose whichever datasets you'd like from the past several months as the subject for your mapping. You'll need to use at least one tabular join, one spatial join, and one extraction to create the dataframe. Load the packages, the data, and make sure everything is projected here. Give me a sense for what you are hoping to map.

```{r loadlibrary}
library(terra)
library(sf)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tmap)
library(viridis)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)


data <- list.files("/opt/data/session14/")
data

# Questions: Which protected area has the most species richness? And are the
# most species rich protected areas visited the most?

pas.shp <- read_sf("/opt/data/session14/reg_pas.shp")
mamm.rich <- rast("/opt/data/session16/Mammals_total_richness.tif")
mamm.rich <- catalyze(mamm.rich)
mamm.rich <- mamm.rich[[2]]
park.visits <- read.csv("/opt/data/session14/ParkVisits_2020IWPW.csv", skip = 3)

```

# create outline map
```{r}
west.states <- tigris::states(cb=TRUE) %>% 
  filter(STUSPS == c("ID", "MT", "WY", "CO", "NM", "AZ", "CA", "NV", "OR", "WA", "UT"))
```


# Check geometries

```{r geocheck}
st_is_valid(pas.shp)
pas.shp.valid <- st_make_valid(pas.shp)
st_is_valid(pas.shp.valid)

# keep only columns I need
pas.shp.valid <- pas.shp.valid %>%
  select(Unit_Nm, State = Stat_Nm, geometry)
```

# Check CRS
```{r crscheck}

st_crs(pas.shp.valid)$proj4string
st_crs(mamm.rich)

# shapefile needs to be in same CRS as raster
# DON'T REPROJECT RASTERS

# first turn polygon sf into vector before reprojecting:

pa.vect <- as(pas.shp.valid, "SpatVector")

pa.vect.proj <- project(pa.vect, mamm.rich)

crs(pa.vect.proj) == crs(mamm.rich)

# crop mammal rich to protected areas vector:

mam.rich.crop <- crop(mamm.rich, pa.vect.proj)
```

# Tablular Join
Join park visit data to Protected Area's shapefile data

```{r}

list(unique(park.visits$ParkType))

# now change name strings to match park visit ParkName format:
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Park", "NP", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Monument", "NM", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Battlefield", "NB", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Historical Park", "NHP", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Reserve", "NR", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Seashore", "NS", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Recreation Area", "NRA", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Historic Site", "NHS", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Preserve", "NPRES", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Memorial", "NMEM", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Parkway", "MEM PKWY", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)
pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm <- gsub("National Wild & Scenic River", "W&SR", pa.vect.proj$Unit_Nm)

plot(pa.vect.proj)


# clean up park visit and make visits numeric so they can be added together
park.visits$RecreationVisits <- as.numeric(gsub(",","", park.visits$RecreationVisits))
park.visits <- rename(park.visits, Unit_Nm = ParkName)

# group by park and state
ann.park.visits <- park.visits %>% 
  group_by(UnitCode, Unit_Nm, State) %>% 
  summarise(., Visits = sum(RecreationVisits))


```
# Join to create dataframe
```{r}

pa.summary <- left_join(st_as_sf(pa.vect.proj), ann.park.visits)

# extract
pa.zones <- terra::rasterize(pa.vect.proj, mam.rich.crop, field = "Unit_Nm")
mammal.zones <- terra::zonal(mam.rich.crop, pa.zones, fun = "mean", na.rm=TRUE)

# now combine all into one dataframe
summary.df <- pa.summary %>% 
  left_join(., mammal.zones)
```



# Task 3: Build a map with Tmap
Practice making a quick map with tmap. 

```{r tmap}

tm_shape(summary.df) + tm_polygons(col = "Visits",  border.col = "white") + 
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)


tm_shape(mam.rich.crop) +
  tm_raster("Value", palette = viridis(n=50), n=50, legend.show=FALSE, legend.hist = TRUE, legend.hist.title = "Species Richness") +
tm_shape(summary.df) +
  tm_polygons(col = "Visits",  border.col = "white", title="# Visits") + 
  tm_legend(outside = TRUE)


```

# Task 4: Build a choropleth with ggplot
Your map should have a basemap, should rely on more than one aesthetic (color, transparency, etc), and combine multiple layers.



```{r}
ggplot(summary.df) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = Visits))
```

# Task 5: Build 2 cartograms
Follow the examples to build cartograms that display your region of interest based on variables other than area.

```{r}
bg <- ggmap::get_map(as.vector(st_bbox(west.states)))

ggmap(bg) +
   geom_sf(data = summary.df, mapping = aes(fill = Visits), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_sf(data=west.states, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))


# hmm not sure why I'm zoomed in on CA?

# oh guess thats why we change scales next?

ggmap(bg) +
  geom_sf(data = summary.df, mapping = aes(fill = Value, inherit.aes = FALSE)) +
  geom_sf(data=west.states, fill=NA,color="black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option="magma")+
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(4326))

# alright not really sure whats going on right here
```


_Question 3:_ Reflect on the different maps you've made, what do the different visualizations tell you about the data you plotted?

Well, I don't think I picked the best data to look at... very hard to actually see if the parks with the most visits have the highest mean value of species richness...

_Question 4:_ How might you improve the maps you've made?

Uhh... well kind of everything about them haha. I'm not really sure. Kind of brain dead at this point. Will come back to this. 

_Question 5:_ Is a map the best way to evaluate the data you worked with? Why or Why not?

Not necessarily? I think this information could be presented not in map form... Or maybe even a fun interactive way would be better...
